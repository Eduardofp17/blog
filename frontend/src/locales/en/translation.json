  "about-me": "Born in Brazil, Eduardo Pinheiro is an 18-year-old who began learning programming at the age of 15. He is the founder of Nourishnet (a discontinued project), which aimed to help public schools in Brazil enhance food logistics and reduce food waste. Unfortunately, Nourishnet finished 2nd in robotics at the regional science fair. After that, Eduardo decided to discontinue the project. In 2023, he discovered the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics (OBI), a prestigious competition. In his first year participating in the OBI, he ranked 264th out of 5,263 participants. In 2024, Eduardo improved his data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills, qualifying for the national phase and placing 174th out of 5,609 participants.",
